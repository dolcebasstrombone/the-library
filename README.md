# the-library

## Purpose
* This repo is meant to be a JavaScript library full of handy functions for reference in other repos.
* For now, the code is not meant to be functional. A blank html file and empty nested assets have been added because eventually the individual example functions will be showcased in a live page.

## Repo Link
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dolcebasstrombone/the-library)

## Live Page
* Nothing here yet.
